		<p>Provides the adaptability mechanisms used by many JAIL components.</p>
		<p>This package contains the interface and classes which install basic adaptability
		mechanisms used internally by JAIL to keep APIs simple and effective. Main concepts
		of the adaptability patterns (inspired from Eclipse) are the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IAdaptable: this interface allows a component to claim its adaptability. Users
			of the component may then invoke the adapt(Class) method on the object to adapt it
			to some instance of a class of interest.</li>
			<li>IAdapter: this interface allows you to provide adaptabilities from the outside of
			classes. An adapter adapts instances of some class C to instances of class D (for example).
			C is not required to declare itself as IAdaptable. Adapters must be registered to the 
			AdaptUtils utility class.</li>
			<li>AdaptUtils: this class is the main facade for all adaptibility requests. Adapters may
			be registered/unregistered to this class. Request for adaptibility may also be made by
			invoking the adapt method.</li>
		</ul>
