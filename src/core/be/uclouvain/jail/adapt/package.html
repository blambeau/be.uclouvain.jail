		<p>Provides the adaptability mechanisms used by many JAIL components.</p>
		<p>This package contains the interface and classes which install basic adaptability
		mechanisms used internally by JAIL to keep APIs simple and effective. Main concepts
		of the adaptability patterns (inspired from Eclipse) are the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IAdaptable: this interface allows a component to claim its adaptability. Users
			of the component may then invoke the adapt(Class) method on the object to adapt it
			to some instance of a class of interest.</li>
			<li>IAdapter: this interface allows you to provide adaptabilities from the outside of
			classes. An adapter is able to adapt all instances of some class C to instances of another 
			class D (for example). C is not required to declare itself as IAdaptable. Adapters must be 
			registered to the AdaptUtils utility class.</li>
			<li>IOpenAdaptable: this interface, which is an extension of IAdaptable, declares the
			ability of a component to accept external adaptations, through a addAdaptation() method.
			In comparison with IAdapter which installs such an adaptation from a class point of view 
			(that is, for all instances of some class C), open adaptability allows external adaptations
			from an instance point of view.</li>
			<li>AdaptUtils: this class is the main facade for all adaptibility requests. Adapters may
			be registered/unregistered to this class. Request for adaptibility may also be made by
			invoking the adapt method.</li>
			<li>Adaptations: provides a collection of external adaptations. This utility class is mainly
			provided to help implementing the IOpenAdaptable interface.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Because all these adaptability concepts must work together, some priority order is to be 
		respected when implementing adaptable classes. The following priority order should always be
		respected:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IOpenAdaptable has always the higher priority. In other words, instance adaptations 
			must be checked first.</li>
			<li>IOpenAdaptable has the second priority, in other words internal class adaptations are
			the checked.</li>
			<li>IAdapter has the lowest priority</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Said otherwise, the following algorithm should always be implemented when implementing 
		IAdaptable and IOpenAdaptable objects:</p>
		<pre>
			public &lt;T&gt; Object adapt(Class&lt;T&gt; c) {
				// try instance adapation first (when implementing IOpenAdaptable only)
				if (adaptations != null) {
					Object iAdapt = adaptations.adapt(this, c);
					if (iAdapt != null) { return iAdapt; }
				}
				
				// try internal class adaptation
				[...]
				
				// try external class adaptation
				return AdaptUtils.externalAdapt(this,c);
			}
		</pre>
