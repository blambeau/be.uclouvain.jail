		<p>Provides automaton abstractions.</p>
		<p>This package provides the interfaces which installs automaton abstractions
		used by JAIL.</p>
		<p>JAIL works with automata created on top of graphs. This choice has been 
		primary made for the following reason: an automaton can be simply created 
		by decoration o radaptation of graphs (that is, an automata can be seen as 
		a view defined on a graph, which allows graph competing implementations, 
		graph algorithms and graph I/O dialects to be still used when working on 
		automata.</p>
		<p>It's important to note that the underlying graph is actually used by 
		many of the implemented automaton algorithms. In other words the getGraph()
		method of automaton contracts must be implemented ! If you have some data-structure 
		that represents an automaton but which cannot be converted to a NFA/DFA simply, 
		you can use the {@link DFAGraphAdapter} class to implement that method.</p>
