		<p>Provides a DirectedGraph implementation based on an adjacency list data structure.</p>
		<p>The graph implementation here is kept as widely opened as possible. For this reason,
		some interface are introduced here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IEdge and IVertex: these interfaces allows you to create your own edge and vertex
			implementations to be used as adjacency graph sub-components. Some (maybe) good reason 
			to implement these interfaces is to provide an efficient special-purpose implementation.</li>
			<li>IGraphComponentFactory: this interface allows the AdjacencyDirectedGraph class to
			create actual edge and vertex instances to be used.</li>
		</ul>
