		<p>Provides a useful graph decorator on top of any graph implementation.</p>
		<p>This package is mainly introduced to keep the IDirectedGraph interface
		as simple as possible, in order to let users to implement graphs easily.
		Many methods are however required to use graphs in practice. The DirectedGraph
		class provides all these useful methods by decoration of any graph.</p>
		<p>Please always get an instance of DirectedGraph by adaptation instead of
		explicit constructor invocation (to avoid decoration chains) :</p>
		<pre>
			// I've got some graph
			IDirectedGraph graph = [...]
			
			// always prefer adaptation ...
			DirectedGraph deco = (DirectedGraph) graph.adapt(DirectedGraph.class);
			
			// ... to explicit constructor invocation
			DirectedGraph deco = new DirectedGraph(graph);
		</pre>
