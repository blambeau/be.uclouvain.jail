/**
 * Defines a constraint to be respected by a graph.
 * 
 * <p>Contraints are the way to ensure some properties on graphs. They typically
 * implement or use a {@link IGraphListener} to listen to graph changes and throw 
 * @{link GraphConstraintViolationException} when changes tend to violate the 
 * graph constraint.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Constraints may be used in two different ways: by installation on graph, or 
 * by external test. The first way uses the following syntax (for some GraphUniqueIndex 
 * constraint, for example):</p>
 * <pre>
 *     // consider some graph instance
 *     DirectedGraph graph = [...]
 *     
 *     // create a unique constraint and install it on graph
 *     GraphUniqueIndex index = new GraphUniqueIndex(...).installOn(graph);
 *     
 *     // the index may also be used after installation
 *     index.get(...)
 * </pre>
 * <p>Warning that, besides the strange API of constraints, the same constraint 
 * instance may not be installed on two different graphs. The only reason why the
 * constraint returns itself at installOn invocation is to provide a simple way to
 * create and install the constraint at once (because, as for GraphUniqueIndex, some 
 * constraints provide useful effects to be used after installation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The second way is quite simple and has no effect on the graph:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     // consider some graph instance
 *     DirectedGraph graph = [...]
 *     
 *     // just check some graph constraint from the outside
 *     // are vertex ids unique on my graph?
 *     boolean unique = new GraphUniqueIndex(GraphUniqueIndex.VERTEX,"id",true)
 *                         .isRespectedBy(graph):
 * </pre>
